## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to BessBench, a benchmark designed for measuring the performance of foundation models in battery energy storage and home energy management scenarios. This tool helps evaluate how well models can perform in real-world energy settings. We focus on key metrics that matter in the energy sector.

## 📊 Metrics
BessBench uses a set of evaluation criteria inspired by ElecBench. Here are the metrics we assess:

1. **Expressiveness**: How well can the model convey complex ideas?
2. **Factuality**: Are the model's outputs correct and true?
3. **Logicality**: Does the model follow a logical reasoning process?
4. **Stability**: How consistent are the model's responses over time?
5. **Fairness**: Does the model treat all scenarios impartially?
6. **Security**: How well does the model handle security concerns?
7. **Agentic Abilities**: This includes multi-step reasoning, long-term planning, and tool use.

We added a new dimension—agentic abilities—to reflect the needs for large language models to act as agents in real-world tasks.
